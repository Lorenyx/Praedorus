A discord bot mainly built for a Destiny 2 server I host. It has some cool tools and is still a work in progress.

If you have any questions ask them here and feel free to copy, modify and use this code as you like. 

Current commands are:
  * help -    Shows this message.
  * add -     Adds two numbers together.
  * fireteam - $[fireteam] [name][light level][character class]
  * roster -   Shows Guardians in current fireteam
  * roll -    Rolls a dice in NdN format.
  * choose -  Chooses between multiple choices.
  * repeat -  Repeats a message multiple times.
  * joined -  Says when a member joined.
  * cool -    Says if a user is cool.
